# MSCS532_Assignment5

## Description
This assignment focuses on implementing and empirically evaluating the QuickSort algorithm with and without randomization. It compares their performance using execution time across various input sizes.

## Files

- `quicksort.py`: Standard QuickSort implementation.
- `quicksort_randomized.py`: QuickSort algorithm using randomized pivot selection.
- `empirical_analysis.py`: Driver script to benchmark and compare both algorithms on different array sizes.
- `output.txt`: Terminal output showing execution time results for each sorting method.

## How to Run
Open your terminal inside the project directory and run:

python empirical_analysis.py > output.txt
